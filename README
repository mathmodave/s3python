A centralised set of python procedures/functions that may form the basis of a fully featured program utilising Amazon's S3 service.

The source included is enough to complete the following functions:

List All Buckets
List Contents of an individual bucket
Create Bucket
Delete Empty Bucket
Upload a file from the local filesystem into a specified bucket
Download a file from a specified bucket either to stdout or the local filesystem
Delete a file from a specified bucket
Add and Remove the READ permission from the AllUsers? group.
Documentation is admittedly lacking

Test harness is also admittedly lacking

s3commands.py is intended as an API to be called from other programs s3.py is intended to be used from the command line to manipulate the file store

Before using the above, you will have to edit s3commands.py to point it at the location of two files which contain the two keys ("public/private") that are provided by Amazon S3.
